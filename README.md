## Data Description
This is a copy of UCI ML Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) datasets. (https://goo.gl/U2Uwz2)

**Number of Instances**: 569

**Number of Attributes**: 30 numeric, predictive attributes and the class

**Attribute Information**:
* radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
* texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
* perimeter
* area
* smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
* compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
* concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
* concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
* symmetry
* fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
* class (WDBC-Malignant - 0, WDBC-Benign - 1)

(The mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three worst/largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features.  For instance, field 0 is Mean Radius, field 10 is Radius SE, field 20 is Worst Radius).

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
